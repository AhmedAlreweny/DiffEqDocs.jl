# DifferentialEquations.jl Documentation

DifferentialEquations.jl is a package for solving numerically solving differential
equations in Julia by Chris Rackauckas. The purpose of this package is to supply
efficient Julia implementations of solvers for various differential equations.
Equations within the realm of this package include ordinary differential equations
(ODEs), stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs), stochastic
partial differential equations (SPDEs), partial differential equations (with both
finite difference and finite element methods), differential algebraic equations
(DAEs), and differential delay equations (DDEs). The well-optimized
DifferentialEquations solvers benchmark as the fastest Julia implementations,
using classic algorithms and ones from recent research, and include algorithms
optimized for high-precision and HPC applications.  It integrates with the
Julia package sphere, for example using Juno's progress meter, automatic plotting,
built-in interpolations, and wraps other differential equation solvers so
that many different methods for solving the equations can be accessed by
simply switching a keyword argument. It utilizes Julia's generality to be
able to solve problems specified with arbitrary number types (types with
units like Unitful, and arbitrary precision numbers like BigFloats and
ArbFloats), arbitrary sized arrays (ODEs on matrices), and more. This gives
a powerful mixture of speed and productivity features to help you solve and
analyze your differential equations faster.

All of the algorithms are thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy. Convergence tests are included in the [test/](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/test) folder. The algorithms were also tested to show correctness with nontrivial behavior such as Turing morphogenesis. Example IJulia notebooks
[can be found in the examples folder](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/examples). If you find any example where there seems
to be an error, please open an issue.

If you have any questions, or just want to chat about solvers/using the package, please feel free to message me in the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/JuliaDiffEq/Lobby). For bug reports, feature requests, etc., please submit an issue. If you're interested in contributing, please see the [Contributor's Guide](http://juliadiffeq.github.io/DifferentialEquations.jl/latest/internals/contributors_guide.html).

## Using the Package

To install the package, use the following command inside the Julia REPL:
```julia
Pkg.add("DifferentialEquations")
```

For all of the latest features, switch to the master branch via:

```julia
Pkg.checkout("DifferentialEquations")
```

To load the package, use the command:

```julia
using DifferentialEquations
```

To understand the package in more detail, check out the following tutorials in the manual. Examples
IJulia notebooks using DifferentialEquations can be found [in the examples folder](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/examples).
Codes for the latest features can be found in [test/](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/test).

## Supported Equations

For PDEs, one can optionally specify a noise equation. The solvers currently have
stochastic variants for handling Gaussian Space-time white noise SPDEs.

* ODEs
* SODEs
* DAEs
* (Stochastic) PDEs

  * Linear Poisson Equation
  * Semi-linear Poisson Equation
  * Linear Heat Equation
  * Semi-linear Heat Equation (aka Reaction-Diffusion Equation)
  * Stationary Stokes Equation

For help with choosing a solver algorithm, please see the solver options pages.

## IJulia Notebook Tutorials

If you have [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) installed, you can access
extra tutorials in the supplied IJulia notebooks via:

```julia
using IJulia
notebook(dir = Pkg.dir("DifferentialEquations")*"/examples")
```

Otherwise, these notebooks can be viewed [via the Github repository](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl/tree/master/examples)
(note that Github renders them slightly incorrectly, so it will look better in IJulia!).
