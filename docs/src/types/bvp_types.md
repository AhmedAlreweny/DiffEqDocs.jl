# BVP Problems

## Mathematical Specification of an BVP Problem

To define an BVP Problem, you simply need to give the function ``f`` and the initial
condition ``uâ‚€`` which define an ODE:

```math
\frac{du}{dt} = f(u,p,t)
```

along with an implicit function `bc!` which defines the residual equation, where

```math
bc(u,p,t) = 0
```

is the manifold on which the solution must live. A common form for this is the
two-point `BVProblem` where the manifold defines the solution at two points:

```math
u(t_0) = a
u(t_f) = b
```

## Problem Type

### Constructors

```julia
TwoPointBVProblem{isinplace}(f,bc!,u0,tspan)
BVProblem{isinplace}(f,bc!,u0,tspan)
```

For any BVP problem type, `bc!` is the inplace function:

```julia
bc!(residual, u, p, t)
```

where `residual` computed from the current `u`. `u` is an array of solution values
where `u[i]` is at time `t[i]`, while `p` are the parameters. For a `TwoPointBVProblem`,
`t = tspan`. For the more general `BVProblem`, `u` can be all of the internal
time points, and for shooting type methods `u=sol` the ODE solution.
Note that all features of the `ODESolution` are present in this form.
In both cases, the size of the residual matches the size of the initial condition.

### Fields

* `f`: The function for the ODE.
* `bc`: The boundary condition function.
* `u0`: The initial condition. Either the initial condition for the ODE as an
  initial value problem, or a `Vector` of values for ``u(t_i)`` for collocation
  methods
* `tspan`: The timespan for the problem.
