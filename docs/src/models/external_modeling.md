# External Modeling Packages

This is a list of modeling packages built upon the JuliaDiffEq ecosystem.

## DynamicalSystems.jl

[DynamicalSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl)
is a package for the exploration of continuous and discrete dynamical systems.
It uses DifferentialEquations.jl for the continuous systems and enables the
computation of things like Lyopunov exponents.

## BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl

[BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl](https://github.com/PoisotLab/BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl)
is a package for simulations of biomass flows in food webs.

## SwitchTimeOpt.jl

[SwitchTimeOpt.jl](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/SwitchTimeOpt.jl) is a Julia
package to easily define and efficiently solve switching time optimization (STO)
problems for linear and nonlinear systems.

## VehicleModels.jl

[VehicleModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMPC/VehicleModels.jl) is a package for
simulating vehicle models.

## MADS.jl

[MADS.jl](https://github.com/madsjulia/Mads.jl) is a package data and model
analysis. It adds many sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification,
and model selection routines.
