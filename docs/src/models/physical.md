# Physical Models

The physical modeling functionality is provided by DiffEqPhysics.jl and helps
the user build and solve the differential equation based physical models.

## Hamiltonian Problems

ODEs defined by Hamiltonians is described in the
[Dynamical ODEs section](../../types/dynamical_types.html).

## N-Body Problems
