# Callback Library

DiffEqCallbackLibrary.jl provides a library of various helpful callbacks which
can be used with any component solver which implements the callback interface.
It adds the following callbacks which are available to users of DifferentialEquations.jl.

## Callbacks

### Manifold Conservation and Projection

In many cases, you may want to declare a manifold on which a solution lives.
Mathematically, a manifold `M` is defined by a function `g` as the set of points
where `g(u)=0`. An embedded manifold can be a lower dimensional object which
constrains the solution. For example, `g(u)=E(u)-C` where `E` is the energy
of the system in state `u`, meaning that the energy must be constant (energy
preservation). Thus by defining the manifold the solution should live on, you
can retain desired properties of the solution.

It is a consequence of convergence proofs both in the deterministic and stochastic
cases that post-step projection to manifolds keep the same convergence rate
(stochastic requires a truncation in the proof, details details), thus any algorithm
can be easily extended to conserve properties. If the solution is supposed to live
on a specific manifold or conserve such property, this guarantees the conservation
law without modifying the convergence properties.

#### Constructor

```julia
ManifoldProjection(g;nlsolve=NLSOLVEJL_SETUP(),save=true)
```

- `g`: The residual function for the manifold: `g(u,resid)`. This is an inplace function
  which writes to the residual the difference from the manifold components.
- `nlsolve`: A nonlinear solver as defined [in the nlsolve format](linear_nonlinear.html)
- `save`: Whether to do the standard saving (applied after the callback)

#### Example

Here we solve the harmonic oscillator:

```julia
u0 = ones(2)
f = function (t,u,du)
  du[1] = u[2]
  du[2] = -u[1]
end
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,(0.0,100.0))
```

However, this problem is supposed to conserve energy, and thus we define our manifold
to conserve the sum of squares:

```julia
function g(u,resid)
  resid[1] = u[2]^2 + u[1]^2 - 2
  resid[2] = 0
end
```

To build the callback, we just call

```julia
cb = ManifoldProjection(g)
```

Using this callback, the Runge-Kutta method `Vern7` conserves energy:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,Vern7(),callback=cb)
@test sol[end][1]^2 + sol[end][2]^2 â‰ˆ 2
```

### AutoAbstol

Many problem solving environments [such as MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/gui/absolute-tolerance.html)
provide a way to automatically adapt the absolute tolerance to the problem. This
helps the solvers automatically "learn" what appropriate limits are. Via the
callback interface, DiffEqCallbacks.jl implements a callback `AutoAbstol` which
has the same behavior as the MATLAB implementation, that is the absolute tolerance
starts and at each iteration it is set to the maximum value that the state has thus
far reached times the relative tolerance. If `init_curmax` is zero, then the initial
value is determined by the `abstol` of the solver. Otherwise this is the initial
value for the current maximum abstol.

To generate the callback, use the constructor:

```julia
AutoAbstol(save=true;init_curmax=0.0)
```
