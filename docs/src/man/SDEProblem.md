# Defining a SDE Problem

To define an SDE Problem, you simply need to give the forcing function ``f``,
the noise function `g`, and the initial condition ``u₀`` which define an SDE

```math
du = f(t,u)dt + Σgᵢ(t,u)dWⁱ
```

`f` and `g` should be specified as `f(t,u)` and  `g(t,u)` respectively, and `u₀`
should be an AbstractArray whose geometry matches the desired geometry of `u`.
Note that we are not limited to numbers or vectors for `u₀`, one is allowed to
provide `u₀` as arbitrary matrices / higher dimension tensors as well. A vector
of `g`s can also be defined to determine an SDE of higher Ito dimension.
