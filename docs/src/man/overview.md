# Overview of DifferentialEquations.jl

The general workflow for using the package is as follows:

* Define a problem
* Generate a mesh
* Use a solver on the problem and mesh
* Analyze the output

Problems are specified via a type interface. For example, for the Poisson equation
``Δu = f``, one defines a type which holds `f` and the boundary condition functions.
Many examples problems can be found in [src/premades/premade_problems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl/blob/master/src/premades/premade_problems.jl)


Next, for PDE problems, one generates a mesh. For example, if one wants to solve the Heat equation
in the parabolic cylinder of the unit square, i.e. ``[0,1]^2 \times [0,T]``, then one
has to discretize this. Tools within the package will generate meshes from
general characteristics. For example, most tools require only specifying the
general shape, Δx, Δt, and T and will generate the mesh.

One then passes the mesh and the problem to the solver interface. The solver then
solves the differential equation using the some numerical methods (which can be
specified via keyword arguments). The solver returns a solution object which
hold all of the details for the solution.

With the solution object, you do the analysis as you please! For some result `sol`,
the field `sol.u` returns the final solution, and if you give a true solution,
`sol.u_analytic` is the true solution at the final time. If you specified to the solver
`save_timeseries=true`, then `sol.timeseries` and `sol.ts` will be outputted which hold the
solution/time at every `timeseries_steps` (default set to 100, meaning it saves an output
every 100 steps).

Plotting functionality is provided by a recipe to Plots.jl. To
use plot solutions, simply call the `plot(type)` and the plotter will generate
appropriate plots. If `save_timeseries` was used, the plotters can
generate animations of the solutions to evolution equations.
Plots can be customized using all of the keyword arguments
provided by Plots.jl. Please see Plots.jl's documentation for more information.

# Extras for Developers and Researchers

DifferentialEquations.jl also provides some helper functionality to assist
with general forms of analysis. The problem types allow one to optionally
specify the true solution. When this is given to the solver, the solution
object returns with many error calculations. An array of solutions
can be made into a `ConvergenceSimulation` (or the test_convergence functions
can be used) which then generates all of the convergence test results and
allows for plotting (great for developing new methods!). The benchmark suite
allows one to compare between methods and easily plot
the results. Recipes are provided for Runge-Kutta tableaus to plot stability
regions.
